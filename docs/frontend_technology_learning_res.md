**User**

Please summarize technologies used for the frontend, and try to find courses on https://www.coursera.org/ that could help me to jump into frontend code quickly. The courses should be as new as possible, should have a as highest rating as possible, preferably not less than 4.8, and should be part of program, or should be a single course that covers the technologies used for my fronted, if possible.

### ⚠️ Note on Specific Libraries

Unfortunately, Coursera doesn't offer dedicated courses for the more specialized libraries in your stack like:
- **TanStack Query/Table** 
- **React Hook Form + Zod**
- **Tailwind CSS** (usually covered briefly in general frontend courses)

For these, I'd recommend checking:
- **Official documentation** (TanStack has excellent docs)
- **YouTube tutorials** from creators like Theo, Web Dev Simplified, or Fireship
- **Scrimba** or **Frontend Masters** for more specialized content
